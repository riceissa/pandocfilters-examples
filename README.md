# Examples of Pandoc filters

This repository contains various examples of Pandoc filters, using the [pandocfilters](https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters) Python module.
So far, most of the filters are just Python implementations of the Haskell examples on the [scripting page](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html).

When writing filters, printing out the abstract syntax tree using `-t native`
or `-t json` on Pandoc is helpful. All a filter does it manipulate that JSON
file to get another JSON file, which feeds back into Pandoc. The trick is to
not mess up the JSON, because if you do Pandoc won't like it.

For [Lua filters](http://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html), the same trick works,
but there is no intermediate JSON step, so it takes more imagination to see
what's going on. Even more unfortunately, Lua lacks a native way to print
tables (its list/dictionary data structure), and since the Lua library is
embedded in the Pandoc executable, it doesn't seem easy to download a library
like [Penlight](https://stevedonovan.github.io/Penlight/api/libraries/pl.pretty.html#dump)
to dump tables for inspection. Lua filters *are* faster and don't require
GHC/Python though.
